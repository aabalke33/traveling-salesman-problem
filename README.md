## Prompt
A Parcel Service needs to determine the best route and delivery distribution for their Daily Local Deliveries. The route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day; each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements. Your task is to write code that determines and presents a solution delivering all 40 packages on time, according to their criteria while reducing the total number of miles traveled by the trucks.

1. Store the package information in a hash table.
2. Uses a self-adjusting heuristic algorithm to find a solution that delivers all packages using under 140 miles and according to the provided requirements (e.g., delivery deadlines, addresses, number of trucks, special notes, etc.).
3. Allows the ‘user’ to check the status (at the hub, en route, or delivery time) of any package at any given time.
